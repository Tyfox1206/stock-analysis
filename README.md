# Stock Analysis

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

   The purpose of this analysis is to find what stocks had a gain and which stocks had a lose throughout a specific year. This allows those looking at the data to determine which stocks they would like to invest in and allow them to make the best-informed decision with the data available to them. I took data on 12 stock symbols and then ran a macro to determine the total volume of stocks traded for that symbol in that year. As well as took the lowest closing price and the highest closing price to determine the total gain or lose percentage for that year.
